In Olsson-Collentine et al., (2019) we demonstrate that variation in reliability between the studies included in a meta-analysis will lead to an overestimate of statistical heterogeneity. This point is also made by Hunter and Schmidt (year) whose claims are repeated in a recent paper published by Perspectives on Psychological Science (REF). However, in this article we demonstrate that this overestimate only holds in the absence of true heterogeneity (i.e., under a fixed effect meta-analytic framework). In the presence of true heterogeneity, imperfect reliability in the studies instead leads to an underestimate of the true heterogeneity.
